"**MXenes** is the general name of two-dimensional transition metal "
"carbides, nitrides or carbonitrides. It is a new type of graphene like "
"two-dimensional structural material jointly discovered by Professor Yury "
"Gogotsi of Drexel University and Professor Michel W. Barsoum in 2011. The"
" general chemical formula can be expressed as :math:`M_{n+1}X_{n}T_{x}`, "
"where M refers to transition metals (such as Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, "
"Sc, etc.), X refers to C or N, n generally 1-3, and T refers to surface "
"groups (such as :math:`O^{2-}`, :math:`OH^-`, :math:`F^-`, etc.). It is "
"mainly obtained by extracting weakly bound A-site elements (such as Al "
"atoms) from the MAX phase through the mixed solution of HF acid or "
"hydrochloric acid and fluoride. Due to the diversity of the composition "
"and structure of the MAX phase, **MXene** materials derived from it have "
"also become the largest family of two-dimensional materials, with more "
"than 100 theoretically predicted and more than 40 currently synthesized."

"**MXene**'s unique two-dimensional layered structure, high density, "
